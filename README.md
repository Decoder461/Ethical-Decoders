# Cardless ATM application:
---------------------------
Allow customers to connect to their bank account via an OTP instead of debit card so that they can transact using their mobile phone. 
By adding this CARDLESS feature in ATM, one can withdrawal money by merely providing mobile Number/Customer ID. Once the details are verified, a 4-digit OTP will be sent to your registered number via SMS. After that user needs to provide OTP along with 4 digit secure PIN (pre-set by Customer) which will then be authenticated and allow customers to use all services of ATM. 

This solution is built on Python language using DJANGO.
